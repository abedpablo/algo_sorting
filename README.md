# Algorithm Sorting Visualizer
I began this project to learn and understand the common algorithms used
in computer science. The project was inspired by this <a href="https://youtu.be/kPRA0W1kECg">sorting algorithm visualizer</a>
video (<a href="https://github.com/bingmann/sound-of-sorting">repository here</a>).

Through this project, I learned a lot about the methods and techniques
of theoretical computer science and algorithm analysis. I was able to
utlize tools such binary trees and generators along with staying aware  
of time and space complexities. 

## Algorithms
Selection sort, Insertion sort, Quick sort, Merge sort, Heap sort,
Radix sort (LSD), Radix sort (MSD), Shell sort, Bubble sort, Cocktail 
Shaker sort, Gnome sort, Bitonic sort, and Bogo sort
