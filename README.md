# Algorithm Sorting Visualizer
I began this project to learn and understand the common algorithms used
in computer science. The project was inspired by this <a href="https://youtu.be/kPRA0W1kECg">sorting algorithm visualizer</a>
video (<a href="https://github.com/bingmann/sound-of-sorting">repository here</a>).

Through this project, I learned a lot about the methods and techniques
of theoretical computer science and algorithm analysis. I was able to
utlize tools such binary trees and generators along with staying aware  
of time and space complexities.
